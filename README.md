Welcome on my portfolio
- I am currently studying electrical engineering because I am interested in machine learning, AI, and robotics. 
- Furthermore, I want to create desktop application and learn more about API's.
- I’m working with Java and C and trie a lot of differenz methods / funktion's and creating a lot of Repositories. Some of them are public and you can use the code or comment if you want to share some knowledge.
- My start with Java was at the 24.10.2022 
- C-Programming start at the 24.09.2023
- I also have experiance with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (but I'm not intrested in Web developing)

- I’m looking to collaborate on GitHub with other developers that think like I do. Also creating a Portfolio for Future contracts with companies.
- Best way to reach me is to text on Discord sending me an E-Mail.
