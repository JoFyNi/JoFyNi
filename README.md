- Welcome on my portfolio 
- I’m currently learning Java and testing a lot of differenz methods / funktion's and creating a lot of Repositories. Some of them are public and you can use the code or comment if you want to share some knowledge.
- I’m looking to collaborate on GitHub with other Java Developers that think like I do. Also creating a Portfolio for Future contracts with companies.
- Best way to reach me is to text on WhatsApp, Discord, Telegramm or sending me an E-Mail.
